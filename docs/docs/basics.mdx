# Basics

If you are familiar with lodash's [deep set / get functions](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#set) or the [formik](https://formik.org/) library, most of the functionality will be clear to you.

## Overview

`stocked` keeps all data in context. After that, you can watch the value changes using the `useStockValue` (if you don't want to edit the value), `useStockState` hooks or using `watch` function.

## Data

Data is saved as one, **non-circular** object.

:::caution

Be careful! `stocked` does not support circular objects.

:::

### Standard API

To change value, you need to call deep set or get functions. For example:

```js
stock.setValue('path.to.value', 'testValue');
```

To get deep value, you can use function `getValue`:

```js
stock.getValue('path.to.value');
```

To observe value changes, use `watch` function:

```js
const cleanup = stock.watch('path.to.value', newValue => {
    // your code...
});

// call cleanup when your component unmounts
cleanup();
```

### React-like API

If you're fan of React hooks, you can use some helper hooks from `stocked` for easier state manipulation. For example:

```js
const value = useStockValue('path.to.value');
```

This hook will return actual value for you. No observers and cleanups - everything is built-in!

If you like React `useState` hook, `stocked` also has something for you:

```js
const [value, setValue] = useStockState('path.to.value');
```

## Playgrounds

Here is a list of playgrounds, where you can try `stocked`:

### Deep get / set playground

> Try to specify path to the deep variable in the input below to see the instant result!

import { DeepPathPreview } from '../src/components/DeepPathPreview';

<DeepPathPreview
    object={{
        hello: {
            asdf: 'hello',
            co: 'asdf',
            c: {
                hello: 0,
            },
        },
        arr: [
            'asdf',
            {
                h: {
                    d: 'asdf',
                },
            },
        ],
    }}
    initialPath="hello"
/>
